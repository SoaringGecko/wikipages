# wikipages
This is a website that I made a WHILE back when I was bored so I could more easily access games wiki's through the steam browser. This was until Terraria, the only reason I used this, had it's wiki moved to a site that the steam browser didn't support and I lost interest. Steams new big ui update (2023) fixes this problem, so I thought to myself yeah I'm going to redo some things for this website.

All I changed was the look (not much, I lazy) and added a way to easily add more wiki's to the website for anyone with a Github account. Oh and I guess I did also add a way to search through the wiki's on the site.
